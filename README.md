> A simple email template generator using Gulp

POSHTA helps you bootstrap an email template using Gulp and [Ink](https://github.com/zurb/ink) templates. CSS is inlined automatically, but you should write your custom styles in your `html` file itself to make sure LiveRelod works correctly. You should also disable your cache while developing for LiveReload to work correctly.

POSHTA is based off my [CEKTOP](https://github.com/ESWAT/CEKTOP) static site generator.
